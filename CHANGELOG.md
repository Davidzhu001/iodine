## Changes:

***

Change log v.0.1.1

**Feature**: WebsocketClient now supports both an auto-connection-renewal and a polling machanism built in to the `WebsocketClient.connect` API. The polling feature is mostly a handy helper for testing, as it is assumed that connection renewal and pub/sub offer a better design than polling.

Change log v.0.1.0

**First actual release**:

We learn, we evolve, we change... but we remember our past and do our best to help with the transition and make it worth the toll it takes on our resources.

I took much of the code used for GRHttp and GReactor, changed it, morphed it and united it into the singular Iodine gem. This includes Major API changes, refactoring of code, bug fixes and changes to the core approach of how a task/io based application should behave or be constructed.

For example, Iodine kicks in automatically when the setup script is done, so that all code is run from within tasks and IO connections and no code is run in parallel to the Iodine engine.

Another example, Iodine now favors Object Oriented code, so that some actions - such as writing a network service - require classes of objects to be declared or inherited (i.e. the Protocol class).

This allows objects to manage their data as if they were in a single thread environment, unless the objects themselves are calling asynchronous code. For example, the Protocol class makes sure that the `on_open` and `on_message(data)` callbacks are excecuted within a Mutex (`on_close` is an exception to the rule since it is assumed that objects should be prepared to loose network connection at any moment).

Another example is that real-life deployemnt preferences were favored over adjustability or features. This means that some command-line arguments are automatically recognized (such as the `-p <port>` argument) and thet Iodine assumes a single web service per script/process (whereas GReactor and GRHttp allowed multiple listening sockets).

I tested this new gem during the 0.0.x version releases, and I feel that version 0.1.0 is stable enough to work with. For instance, I left the Iodine server running all night under stress (repeatedly benchmarking it)... millions of requests later, under heavey load, a restart wasn't required and memory consumption didn't show any increase after the warmup period.
